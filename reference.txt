Personalized Password Manager and Evaluator
Build a web application that not only generates secure passwords using a Password Generator API but also helps users evaluate their existing passwords, store them securely, and provide breach notifications.

Features
Password Generator:

Integrate an API like Random.org's String Generator or create a custom generator API.
Let users specify preferences such as length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, uppercase/lowercase, and even pronounceability.
Password Strength Evaluator:

Use an open API like Have I Been Pwned to check if a generated or user-submitted password has been exposed in breaches.
Provide strength metrics based on entropy calculations (length, complexity, dictionary words).
Password Categories:

Suggest passwords tailored for different scenarios:
Social Media Accounts: Easy to remember yet secure.
Financial Accounts: Extra-long and complex.
Temporary Access: Expiry-based passwords.
Secure Storage (Optional):

Allow users to store and manage their passwords (encrypted using AES or similar).
Provide folder-like categorization for organizing credentials.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Codes:

Generate and store 2FA codes for websites, providing a complete secure authentication toolkit.
Educational Section:

Educate users on password security best practices.
Include a "Password Hall of Shame" for commonly breached passwords.
API Offering:

Expose your password generation features as an API so other developers can integrate them into their own apps.
Tech Stack
Frontend:
React, Next.js, or Vue.js for a responsive UI.
Backend:
Node.js or Python Flask/Django to handle password generation and strength evaluation.
Database:
MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing encrypted user credentials (if storage is provided).
